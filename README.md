```
**Styles**

For the styles, I implement Bootstrap in combination with Sass

**Navigation**

The navigation is through hide and show from Jquery, everything is in the index.html file.

### **`Logic`**

In the store section we have a list of item that we can add to the cart or see their description, in the cart we can delete item by id or empty the total cart. Also we can search by key letters in the input text, that will show us one or many items. If we click on "filter", we can filter by category and by price. At the end if we add items and we click on "ckechout", that will show us a little form for finish the purchase.
